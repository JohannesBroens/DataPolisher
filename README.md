# DataPolisher
*Streamline cleaning, interactive decisions, custom rules, and thorough logging for flawless data.*
## Automated Cleaning
The library should automatically handle common data cleaning tasks like handling missing values, standardizing text (e.g., trimming, case normalization), and removing duplicates.
## Interactive Decision-Making
For ambiguous cases that cannot be decided purely by algorithms (e.g., handling outliers, deciding on data imputation methods), the library should prompt the user for input.
## Custom Rules
Allow users to define custom cleaning rules or scripts for domain-specific data issues.
## Logging and Reporting 
Maintain logs of all cleaning actions and decisions made, either automatically or by the user, to ensure traceability and reproducibility.
